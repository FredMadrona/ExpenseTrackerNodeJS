# Nodejs Full-stack Todo App | Expense Tracker

## Description

While taking an online course on Node.js, I cloned the sample ToDo project and extended it into an Expense Tracker application. This hands-on project helped me apply what I learned from the course, particularly in building full-stack applications with Node.js and Express.

The repository originally contains a simple full-stack ToDo app built using Node.js, Express.js, the EJS template engine, and MongoDB. It serves as an educational resource—primarily for teaching on Udemy—and provides a practical example of creating a CRUD application with a backend API and a frontend interface. By modifying and expanding the project into an Expense Tracker, I gained deeper insight into routing, database operations, and server-side rendering.
