## Description

Taking the online course about node js I cloned the sample todo project to create a expense tracker. Doing this project helped me apply my learnings from the said online course.  
This repository contains a straightforward full-stack todo application built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS template engine, and MongoDB. It serves as an educational resource, particularly for teaching on Udemy, offering a practical example of building a CRUD application with a backend API and a frontend interface.
